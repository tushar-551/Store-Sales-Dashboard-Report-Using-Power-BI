The visuals include charts, tables, and cards displaying metrics such as total sales, total profit, profit breakdown by customer segment and region, sales and profit by product category, and shipping cost analysis.

2. **Tooltip Pages (Slides 5-6)**: These pages showcase the tooltip functionality, providing additional details and insights when hovering over specific data points or visuals.

3. **Drill-Through Option (Slide 3)**: The third page of the report includes a drill-through option, allowing users to navigate to a detailed view of the sales data by clicking on specific data points or visuals.

The report incorporates various types of visuals, including bar charts, line charts, pie charts, tables, cards, and slicers, to effectively communicate the sales data and enable interactive analysis.
