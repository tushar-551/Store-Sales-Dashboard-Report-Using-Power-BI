# Power BI Store Sales Data Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive Power BI report for analyzing store sales data across various dimensions, including product categories, customer segments, regions, and time periods. The report provides valuable insights into sales performance, profitability, and key metrics to support data-driven decision-making.

## Project Overview

* In this project, an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process was performed to clean and transform the raw data using Power Query. Additionally, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) was utilized to create calculated measures and calculated columns, enabling advanced analytics and data manipulation.

* After the data preparation phase, various visualizations were created, including cards, charts, slicers, and tooltips, to present the insights in a user-friendly and interactive manner. The resulting Power BI report offers a comprehensive view of the store's sales data, empowering end-users to make informed decisions.

## Key Features

* **KPI Cards**: Displays key performance indicators, such as total count, total sales, total profit, and total discount.
* **Profit Analysis**: Visualizes the profit breakdown by customer segment, region, product category, and ship mode.
* **Sales Analysis**: Explores sales trends by product category, product container, and year, along with comparisons to target sales.
* **Regional Analysis**: Provides insights into profit and discount distributions across different cities and states/provinces.
* **Drill-through Functionality**: Allows users to drill down into granular data for further exploration.
